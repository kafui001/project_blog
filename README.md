### Contributing

This is a personal website project. The sole purpose is to create a an avenue to display most of my work. Attached to this ia a blog, which at the moment is still a work-in-progress. 

Understanding programming language concepts and topics and the django framework has been one of the toughest but enjoyable journeys as far as career development is concerned for me. The journey has been and is still filled with roadblocks and hair-pulling moments. People like https://github.com/kfwojton of www.fluxmakerspace.com , has been the wind in your sails.My goal with this blog is to pour my knowledge of both python and django out for anyone who wants to go on this AMAZING journey, thus helping make it easier for them than I had.
